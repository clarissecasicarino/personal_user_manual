# Personal User Manual ✨

👋🏼 To start with, my name is Clarisse Casi Cariño, and I’ve always had a deep love for technology 💻. I started programming at the age of 15, and by 21, I landed my first job as a Full Stack Developer — the youngest and only female developer in my team at the time 👩‍💻.

I believe technology has the power to level the playing field, and that’s one of the reasons why I’m passionate about it 🌍. I’m grateful to be a woman in tech, as it allows me to contribute to innovation and break boundaries 🚀.

Outside of tech, I’m a lover of history, culture, and languages 📚🌏. I speak 2.5 languages — English 🇺🇸, Tagalog 🇵🇭, and a bit of French 🇫🇷 — and enjoy diving deep into learning and discovery 🤓.

This manual is meant to help you understand the best ways to collaborate with me, communicate effectively, and get the most out of our working relationship. 💬


## 1. My Values 🌱

### Competence 🏆
I value competence because I see myself as a doer. I naturally expect the people I surround myself with to be goal-oriented and capable of delivering results at a high standard.

### Commitment 🔒
Commitment means a lot to me. I’m always seeking ways to grow and challenge myself, whether it's dedicating a month to learning a new skill or pursuing bigger goals. The discipline to stay committed — even when things get tough — matters to me.

### Communication 🗣️
I value honesty and transparency, but also thoughtfulness. Coming from a conservative culture, I appreciate when people express themselves carefully to avoid misunderstandings. I prioritize asking clarifying questions rather than making assumptions, and I expect the same mindfulness in communication from those I work with.


## 2. My Superpowers – How You Can Get the Best From Me ⚡

### Goal-Getter 🎯
I naturally move toward action. When I set a goal, I pursue it with focus, energy, and persistence. I don't wait around — I take initiative and find ways to make things happen.

### Detail-Oriented 🔍
I care deeply about quality. I naturally spot gaps, inconsistencies, and opportunities for improvement that others might miss. This helps me deliver work that’s thoughtful and complete.

### Excellence 🌟
I set a high bar for myself and the work I produce. I’m committed to delivering at a level that reflects pride, craftsmanship, and true ownership.


## 3. My Weaknesses ⚠️

### Goal-Getter 🏃‍♀️
Because I move quickly, I sometimes push ahead without pausing long enough to bring others fully on the journey. I have to remind myself to slow down and check for alignment.

### Detail-Oriented 🧐
My eye for details can sometimes make it harder for me to "let good enough be good enough" — especially when speed matters more than perfection.

### Excellence 🏅
Sometimes my drive for excellence can slow me down, especially when quick iteration or fast decision-making would be more valuable than polishing every detail.


## 4. My Expectations of Everyone (Including Myself) 🌟

### Collaboration 🤝
By default, I expect everyone to actively engage with their teams, peers, and leaders. We work together to find the best solutions, no matter where the ideas come from.

### Ownership 🎯
If you say you’re going to do something, I expect you to deliver it on time and to the best of your ability. Because that is what I will do as well.

### Help Each Other Out 💪
I believe in the saying that "no man is an island." I want my team to foster a selfless spirit of offering help when we see a team member struggling and getting them up to speed if they’re new to the processes of the team.
